- `Hospice`: Hospice provider
- `PAID`: Payment status (yes/no)
- `Check list`: Completion status
- `DOB`: Date of birth
- `Ingestion Date`: Data entry date
- `Invoice amount`: Billing amount

## 🎨 User Interface

### Dashboard Cards
- **Active Patients**: Total count of current cases

- Action buttons for tasks, calendar events, calls, and emails

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Server (server.js)
- Express.js server running on port 3000
- Single API endpoint: `/api/read-active`
- Serves static files from `public/` directory
- Handles XLSX file reading via `sync.js`

### Data Processing (sync.js)
- Reads Excel files using SheetJS (xlsx library)
- Converts spreadsheet data to JSON objects
- Handles multiple sheets and data types
- Local-first approach with Google Sheets fallback

### Frontend (app.js)
- Vanilla JavaScript for maximum compatibility
- Modular function structure
- Event-driven architecture
- localStorage for local data persistence

### Styling (styles.css)
- Modern CSS with flexbox and grid layouts
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Custom color scheme and typography
- Hover effects and smooth transitions

## 🌐 Google Sheets Integration (Optional)

### Setup Instructions
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing
3. Enable Google Sheets API, Calendar API, and Tasks API
4. Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID (Web application)
5. Add `http://localhost:3000` to authorized origins
6. Update `CLIENT_ID` in `auth.js`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Dashboard not loading:**
- Check if server is running on port 3000
- Verify `Dashboard Clone.xlsx` exists in project root
- Check browser console for error messages

**No data showing:**
- Confirm Excel file has "Active" sheet
- Check server logs for file reading errors
- Test with simple-test.html page

**Port conflicts:**
- Change port in `server.js` if 3000 is occupied
- Update any hardcoded URLs in frontend files

### Debug Tools
- **Test API Button**: Red button in top-right corner
- **Simple Test Page**: http://localhost:3000/simple-test.html
- **Browser Console**: F12 for detailed error logs
- **Server Logs**: Check terminal for backend errors

## 📈 Performance Considerations
