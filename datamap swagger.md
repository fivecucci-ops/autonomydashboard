  title: Hospice Dashboard Data Map
  description: Swagger-like schema for the Dashboard Clone.xlsx dataset. Defines structures for each sheet as API-like models, focusing on data points, types, and relationships. This maps to Google Sheets tabs for the app backend. All dates are Excel serial numbers (convertible to ISO dates). Empties/partials handled as nullable.

Summary of the Document: Dashboard Clone.xlsx
This Excel file appears to be a sample dataset for a medical/hospice patient management system, likely focused on end-of-life care (e.g., references to EOLOA - End of Life Option Act, hospice, prescriptions, ingestions, consents, and death certificates). It contains 6 sheets with structured tabular data. Dates are in Excel serial number format (e.g., 45523 represents a date like 2024-07-01, assuming standard epoch). Data points are primarily strings (names, locations, statuses), numbers (ages, amounts, times), dates, and booleans (yes/no/pending). I've summarized each sheet's structure, key data points, and inferred types below. This uses the provided sample data (including the fake rows I generated), treating empty or partial cells as placeholders. The file emphasizes tracking patient journeys from active to closed/outstanding, outreach, consulting resources, and interactions.

Sheet 0: "Active" (Active Patients Tracking)
Purpose: Tracks ongoing patient cases with detailed lifecycle info, from requests to ingestion, billing, and records.

Overall Document Insights:

Themes: Patient-centric tracking in hospice/EOL care; HIPAA-sensitive in real use (names, DOBs, medical details).
Data Volume: ~10 rows per sheet for testing; scalable.
Common Types: Strings (60%), Numbers/Dates (30%), Booleans (10%). Many empties for incomplete records.
Potential Issues: Typos (e.g., "Oustanding", "incominmg"); inconsistent formats (mixed date/strings).
For App Integration: This structure maps well to Google Sheets tabs; app can dashboard aggregates (e.g., active vs. closed counts, average TTS/TTD).
Detailed Outline of the App: Lightweight Local Notion Clone (Google Sheets Dashboard GUI)
With the summarized data structure, we can now refine the project outline to tailor it specifically to this dataset. The app will serve as a GUI frontend for a Google Sheet mirroring this Excel (e.g., import the XLSX to Sheets first). It runs locally on browsers/computers (e.g., via Electron for desktop), syncs bi-directionally, and provides Notion-like views: dashboards, searchable pages, note-taking with hyperlinks (e.g., to patient emails or external records). Focus on simplicity: vanilla JS core, minimal deps, poll-based sync for live updates across 2+ devices (same Gmail login). Users can search (e.g., patient "Adam Jones" pulls details + notes), add notes (e.g., "Follow-up email: [hyperlink to Gmail]"), and view dashboards (e.g., charts of active patients by area).

Updated Overview
App Name: Hospice Dashboard Clone (or similar).
Goal: "Poor man's Notion/Salesforce" for HIPAA-like data: View/edit patient trackers, outreach, docs, logs; add contextual notes; dashboard visuals; all synced to Google Sheets for collaboration.
Key Constraints: Offline-first (local cache), lightweight (no crashes: <500 lines core code), multi-device via Sheets sync (poll every 30s). Notes stored in a new "Notes" tab, linked to entities (e.g., patient name as key).
Target Users: Medical staff like Donald/Alyssa, on 2 computers.
Data Backend: Google Sheets with tabs matching Excel sheets + "Notes" tab (columns: EntityID (e.g., patient name), NoteText, Hyperlink, Timestamp, User).
Tech Stack: Vanilla JS/HTML/CSS; Google Sheets API (browser-based OAuth); localStorage for cache; optional Chart.js for dashboards, Electron for packaging.
High-Level Architecture
Data Model (Google Sheets Structure):
Import Excel to Sheets: Tabs = Active, Past patient Outreach, Consulting Docs, Closed, Outstanding, Call Log.
Add "Notes" tab: For app-specific annotations (e.g., row: "Adam Jones", "Check DOB accuracy: [link to email]", "https://mail.google.com/...").
Add "DashboardData" tab: Auto-generated via formulas (e.g., COUNTIF for active patients, AVERAGE for TTS minutes).
Keys for Linking: Use Patient Name as primary key for search/notes; fallback to dates for logs.
UI Components (Notion-Like Interface):
Main Layout: Sidebar with tabs (Active, Closed, Outstanding, Outreach, Consulting Docs, Call Log, Notes, Dashboard). Central pane for content.
Search Bar: Global fuzzy search (e.g., "Adam Jones" → card with details from Active sheet + linked notes/hyperlinks; opens in modal).
Dashboard View:
Tables: Grid views of sheets (editable inline).
Charts: e.g., Pie chart of patients by Area (from Active/Closed); Bar for TTS/TTD averages; Line for call logs over time.
Metrics: Cards like "Active Patients: 10", "Outstanding Invoices: 5".
Entity Pages: Click a patient/doctor/call → Dedicated view with all related data (e.g., for "Emily Carter": Active row + outreach if past + notes).
Note Editor: Inline or modal textarea; insert hyperlink button (prompts for URL, e.g., Gmail link). Save pushes to Notes tab. Display notes with clickable links (open in new tab, stay in app).
Sync Indicator: Status bar (e.g., "Synced 10s ago"); button to force sync.
Core Features in Detail:
Dashboarding Data:
Pull from Sheets tabs; render as interactive tables (sortable/filterable via JS).
Visuals: Use Chart.js for simple charts (e.g., age distribution histogram from DOB/Age columns).
Aggregates: JS-calculated (e.g., total invoice amount from Active: sum of "invoice amount" where PAID="no").
Search Functionality:
Input: Any string (e.g., "Stephen Clare" – assume sample addition; searches all tabs for matches in Patient Name, Person contact, etc.).
Output: Results list with snippets (e.g., "Active Patient: Age 55, Area La Jolla") + buttons to view full or add note.
Advanced: Filter by type (e.g., "patients only").
Note-Taking:
Add to any entity (e.g., right-click row → "Add Note").
Shorthand: Support markdown-like (e.g., link text for hyperlinks).
Beyond-Sheet: Notes can reference external (e.g., "HIPAA note: See email [link]"); hyperlinks to Gmail work across same-login browsers.
Sync: On save, append to Notes tab; other users see on next poll.
Multi-User/Computer Sync:
Bi-directional: Read all tabs on load/interval; write changes (edits/notes) immediately.
Conflict: Timestamp-based (overwrite older); notify if detected.
Live Updates: Poll Sheets API every 30s; refresh UI if changes.
Editing: Inline edits to sheet data (e.g., update PAID to "yes"); validate types (e.g., ensure Age is number).
HIPAA Considerations: Local-only; no app storage beyond cache; remind in UI to use secure devices.
Workflow Examples:
Search "Clare Burd": Pulls Active row (age 55, La Jolla); shows notes if any; add note "Tax discussion: [link to email]".
Dashboard: View chart of ingestion locations (private home vs. hospital); click to drill into Closed sheet.
Multi-Device: Edit a call log on Computer 1 → Syncs to Sheets → Computer 2 sees update on refresh.
Stay in App: Click hyperlink in note → Opens Gmail in tab; return to app without leaving.
Development Phases (Refined for This Data):
Phase 1: Setup & Auth: Google API OAuth; import sample XLSX to test Sheet.
Phase 2: Data Sync: Functions to read/write all tabs; parse dates (convert serial to JS Date).
Phase 3: GUI Build: Tabbed interface; search across tabs; note editor with hyperlink support.
Phase 4: Dashboards: Integrate Chart.js; compute aggregates from data types (e.g., sum numbers, count strings).
Phase 5: Features & Test: Inline editing; multi-device simulation; error handling (e.g., invalid date).
Phase 6: Polish: UI for types (date pickers for serial dates); export back to XLSX if needed.
Potential Challenges & Mitigations:
Date Handling: Convert Excel serials (e.g., code: new Date((serial - 25569) * 86400 * 1000)); test with samples.
Data Volume: Limit to 100 rows/tab for perf; paginate if more.
Typos/Inconsistencies: App normalizes (e.g., fix "Oustanding" to "Outstanding" in UI).
Security: Local run; no API keys in code (user inputs creds).
Crashes: Modular code; try-catch on sync; fallback to cache if offline.
