Current Implementation for Notes and Inputs
Based on the app's existing structure (from the screenshot and previous outline), notes are handled as a lightweight, inline feature tied to entities like patients or doctors. Here's what we have so far:

Notes Input:
In the UI (e.g., on the "Active Patients" table or entity detail view), there's a "Add Note" button per row/item. This opens a modal or inline textarea for shorthand text entry.
Supports hyperlink insertion: A button prompts for a URL (e.g., Gmail thread like "https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/[thread-id]"), which gets embedded as a clickable tag in the note display.
Notes are stored in the "Notes" Google Sheets tab (columns: EntityID like "Adam Jones", NoteText, Hyperlink, Timestamp, User). On save, it syncs immediately; other users see updates on poll (every 30s).
Display: Notes appear in a collapsible section below the entity details, with timestamps and user attribution for sharing (e.g., "Alyssa: Check tax docs [link] – 2025-07-10").
Basic Attachments/Extensions:
Currently, no direct "attach task" but notes can reference tasks informally (e.g., "TODO: Follow up on invoice").
Alignment to Datapoints: Notes are linked via EntityID to key fields like Patient Name (from Active/Closed/Outstanding), CP Doctor (from Consulting Docs), or Person Contact (from Call Log). For example, searching "Adam Jones" pulls Active row data (Age: 84, Area: san diego, Invoice: 4200) + associated notes.
This keeps it simple and crash-free, but we can expand for tasks and calendars as you suggested.

Proposed Enhancements: Aligning to Datapoints, Tasks, Calendar, and Sharing
Looking at the datapoints from the summary (e.g., dates as serial numbers, statuses like "pending/complete", yes/no flags for consents/records, invoice/PAID, TTS/TTD times, relationships/emails in Outreach, etc.), we can align features to make the app more productive for Alyssa and Dr. Moore (Donald). Focus on HIPAA-friendly (local run, encrypted Google sync) and multi-user sharing (2-3 people via shared Google Workspace or individual auth with shared resources).

1. Improved Notes Input and Attachments
How to Align Datapoints:
Link notes to specific fields: e.g., right-click a datapoint like "Invoice Amount: 4200" → "Add Note" with auto-prefill "Re: Invoice for [Patient Name]".
For flags like Consent Received ("yes/no"): If "no", prompt to attach a note with reminder text.
For times like TTS/TTD Minutes: Notes can include calculations, e.g., "TTS: 3 min – Note: Monitor for trends".
Outreach/Call Log: Notes on Recipient/Contact Email can hyperlink to email drafts (e.g., "mailto:[email]?subject=Follow-up on [Patient Name]").
New: Attach Task to a Person/Entity:
In the note modal, add a checkbox "Create as Task". Prompts for: Title (auto: "Task for [Patient Name]: [Note Summary]"), Due Date (date picker), Assignee (dropdown: Alyssa, Dr. Moore, or other shared users).
Integrates with Google Tasks API (see below) to create a task in a shared task list. Task description includes hyperlink back to the app entity (e.g., custom URL scheme like "app://patient/[name]").
Storage: Besides Notes tab, add a "Tasks" column in Notes or a new "Tasks" Sheets tab (columns: TaskID from API, EntityID, Title, DueDate, Status, Assignee).
Create Notes Flow:
Shorthand support: Type "/task" to auto-trigger task creation, or "/link" for hyperlink.
Bulk: Select multiple patients (e.g., all with PAID="no") → "Add Group Note/Task".
2. Calendar Integration
Why Align Here? Datapoints are date-heavy (e.g., Date, DOB, 1st/2nd Request, Ingestion Date, Last Contact Date, Physician Follow Up Form). These can auto-generate events for scheduling (e.g., "Follow-up for Clare Burd on [serial-to-date conversion]").
Implementation:
Use Google Calendar API (JS client via gapi) for bi-directional sync.
New Sidebar Tab: "Calendar" – Embeds a simple view (list or mini-calendar) pulling events from a shared calendar.
Auto-Sync: On load/applying changes, map datapoints to events:
e.g., Ingestion Date → Event: "Ingestion: [Patient Name] at [Location]", start/end from date + TTS/TTD minutes.
CP Completed (if date): "CP Follow-up with [CP Doctor]".
Outreach Last Contact Date: If >30 days ago, suggest event "Outreach to [Recipient]".
Manual: Button per date field "Add to Calendar" – Creates event with details (title from patient, description with hyperlinks to notes).
Sharing: Users auth with their Google account; events in a shared calendar (grant access via Google Workspace).
Tech Details (from API quickstart):
Scopes: Add 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar' (full) or '.readonly' initially.
Libraries: gapi.js and gsi/client.js (already in for Sheets).
Sample Code Snippet (integrated in sync.js):
javascript

Collapse

Wrap

Run

Copy
// After gapi init
async function listEvents() {
  const request = await gapi.client.calendar.events.list({
    calendarId: 'primary',
    timeMin: (new Date()).toISOString(),
    maxResults: 10,
    singleEvents: true,
    orderBy: 'startTime',
  });
  // Render events in UI
}
// Create event example
async function createEvent(patientName, dateSerial) {
  const eventDate = new Date((dateSerial - 25569) * 86400 * 1000); // Convert Excel serial
  const event = {
    summary: `Patient: ${patientName} - Ingestion`,
    start: { dateTime: eventDate.toISOString() },
    end: { dateTime: new Date(eventDate.getTime() + 60*60*1000).toISOString() }, // 1 hour
  };
  await gapi.client.calendar.events.insert({ calendarId: 'primary', resource: event });
}
Error Handling: Offline cache events in localStorage; sync when online.
3. Todo List Pages
Alignment to Datapoints:
Generate todos from statuses: e.g., If Check List="in progress", auto-task "Complete checklist for [Patient]".
Outstanding Sheet: All rows → Todos like "Resolve [Patient Name] - [CP Completed=pending]".
Call Log Outcome: If "questions", task "Address questions from [Person Contact] re: [Patient]".
Prioritize by Age/Area (e.g., older patients first) or Invoice Amount (high-value unpaid).
Implementation:
New Sidebar Tab: "Todos" – Table view of tasks, sortable by due date/assignee.
Integrates with Google Tasks API for real sharing (better than Sheets for reminders/notifications).
Features: Create standalone todos, or attach to entities (as above). Mark complete syncs back.
Sharing: Tasks in a shared task list (users add via API; Google handles collab).
Tech Details (from API quickstart):
Scopes: Add 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/tasks'.
Sample Code Snippet:
javascript

Collapse

Wrap

Run

Copy
// List tasks
async function listTasks() {
  const request = await gapi.client.tasks.tasks.list({ tasklist: '@default' });
  // Filter by title containing patient names, render in UI
}
// Create task
async function createTask(title, dueDate, notes) {
  const task = { title, due: dueDate.toISOString(), notes };
  await gapi.client.tasks.tasks.insert({ tasklist: '@default', resource: task });
}
Fallback: If API issues, use a "Todos" Sheets tab (columns: Title, Due, Assignee, Status, LinkedEntity).
4. Multi-Person Sharing (Alyssa, Dr. Donny, etc.)
Approach: Shift from "same Gmail" to per-user Google auth (still lightweight). Users sign in individually; app uses shared Google Cloud project credentials (Client ID/API Key).
How It Works:
Sheets/Calendar/Tasks: Grant access (e.g., share the Sheet file, Calendar, Task list via Google interface).
User Attribution: On notes/tasks/events, add "Created by [User Email]".
Real-Time: Poll more frequently (15s) for changes; notify "Dr. Moore updated note for Adam Jones".
Conflicts: Last-write-wins with timestamps; UI alert for overrides.
Benefits for Few People: Alyssa can assign tasks to Dr. Moore (e.g., "Review records for Frank Davis"); both see calendar events for shared patients.
This enhances the app without bloat—total new code ~200 lines. Test with sample data (e.g., create task for "Clare Burd" due 2025-07-15).
